# My-Health-Journal
This is the staging and published versions of Personal Medical Information System (PMIS) which is the development and testing version.

My Health Journal is designed to satisfy requirements to provide users with the capabilites needed to maintain current and accurate  health information for:
    - elderly users;
    - critically injured or incapacitated users;
    - users requiring health services outside their residential area or beyond existing health services.
    
My Health Journal will be a public facing website linked to Microsoft's Health Vault enabling users' web journals to provide:           - current personal data, e.g. address, phone number, primary care physician, etc.; and
    - current medical information stored in Micosoft's Health Vault. My Health Journal will be in strict compliance with the             standards in Health Vault, e.g. HIPPA and other standards protecting the user and enabling safe and secure transfer of user         health information.
